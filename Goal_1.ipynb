These cities chosen are Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City. \n",

    "<h1>Carbon Monoxide</h1>\n",
    "Carbon Monoxide(CO) is a common topic of discussion when talking about climate change and global warming. It is considered to be one of the biggest impactors to the environment. CO is produced by burning fossil fuels and with the majority of the world still relying on fossil fuels for power, high levels of CO is produced each day. CO is going to be a big factor in this analysis and is going to play a big part in our final conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Nitrogen Dioxide</h1>\n",
    "Nitrogen Dioxide(No2) is part of a group of gaseous air pollutants caused by combustion of fossil fuels. Nitric Oxide (NO) is mainly emitted by road vehicles or other fossil fuel combustion combines with oxygen in the atmosphere producing No2 gas. No2 is also a precursor to a number of other harmful secondary air pollutants such as ozone and particulate matter, discussed more further down. It also plays a role in  the creation of acid rain. Some research states that No2 exposure may affect health independently of any effect of other pollutants but because of its presence is closely linked to the formation or presence of other air polluatants it is difficult to establish the health effects attributable to No2. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Ozone</h1>\n",
    "Ozone can be a double-edged sword for health and the environment, the deciding factor is where it's found in the atmosphere. Ozone found in the stratosphere protects us from ultraviolet radiation from the sun but ground-level ozone can trigger a variety of health problems, especially people who suffer from asthma or any type of lung disease. Ground level ozone is not emitted directly into the air but created by a chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds. This occurs when pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, refineries, etc react in the presence of sunlight. Ozone can reach unhealthy levels on hot sunny days in urban areas and is transported long distances by wind, so rural areas can be effect by high ozone.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Particle Matter</h1>\n",
    "Particle Matter is a term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air that can be inhaled and cause serious health problems. Some particles such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. Others are so small they can only be detected using an electron microscope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particle pollution includes two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "PM10: Inhalable particles that measure 10 micrometers and smaller in diameter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "PM2.5: Fine inhalable particles with diameters that measures 2.5 micrometers and smaller. The average hair on a person is about 70 micrometers in diameter so its about 30 times largest fine particle. \n",
    "\n",
    "These particles can be made up of hundreds of different chemicals and can be emitted from construction sites, unpaved roads or fires. Most particles form in the atmosphere as a result of reactions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emitted from cars, power plants and factories. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Sulfur Dioxide</h1>\n",
    "Sulfur Dioxide(So2) is a invisible gas that reacts easily with other substances to form harmful compounds such as sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid and sulfate particles. Majority of sulfur dioxide in the air comes from human sources such as industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur. Electricity generation from materials like coal, oil or gas can release sulfur into the air, other mineral ores can produce sulfur and release sulfur dioxide when being processed. Other industrial activites that burn fossil fuels containing sulfur can be a main source of sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is also present in vehicle emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breathing in sulfur dioxide can cause a wide range of health problems, it can irritates the nose, throat and cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or tight feeling around the chest. \n"
